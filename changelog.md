# Architect Inventory changelog

---

## [2.2.1] 2021-11-22

### Fixed

- Fixed HTTP route sorting; however you've organized your `@http` pragma, Sandbox should now behave much more like API Gateway; fixes #977
- Fixed overly strict path parameter validation; allow `_`, `.`, `-`; thanks @jkarsrud!

---

## [2.2.0] 2021-11-16

### Added

- Finally formalized `@tables-streams`, the fully customizable successor to `@tables` with `stream true`
- Added `@tables-indexes` pragma
  - `@tables-indexes` has identical semantics as (and will eventually supersede) `@indexes`
  - Until Arc 10.0 + Inventory 3.0, consumers should now check both `inv.indexes` AND `inv.tables-indexes`

---

## [2.1.3] 2021-11-04

### Fixed

- Hardened runtime validation by ensuring non-string values will fail gracefully

---

## [2.1.2] 2021-10-28

### Added

- Added memory / timeout configuration validation


### Changed

- Improved layer validation error formatting

---

## [2.1.1] 2021-10-13

### Added

- Added `config.runtimeAlias` property to Lambdas whose `config.runtime` is interpolated by way of latest-runtime aliasing (e.g. `node` or `py`)


### Changed

- Internal change: implement [Lambda runtimes module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambda-runtimes) instead of maintaining valid runtime list in Inventory


### Fixed

- Fixed `@scheduled` parsing in `app.json` + `package.json` > `arc.scheduled`

---

## [2.1.0] 2021-10-11

### Added

- Added latest-runtime version aliasing
  - Example: you want your app to always run the latest Lambda version of Python (instead of specifying `python3.9`(and changing it every time a new version of Python is released); now you can specify `python` or `py`
  - Valid shortcuts: Node.js: `node`, `nodejs`, `node.js`; Python: `python`, `py`; Ruby: `ruby`, `rb`; Java: `java`; Go: `go`, `golang`; .NET: `dotnet`, `.net`; and custom runtimes: `custom`
- Added runtime validation


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [2.0.7] 2021-09-30

### Added

- Added support for AWS's new Lambda `arm64` architecture via `@aws architecture` setting; default remains `x86_64`


### Changed

- Internal: removed unused `@tables` flag

---

## [2.0.6] 2021-09-14

### Changed

- Internal: Updated Architect Parser to v5

---

## [2.0.5] 2021-09-03

### Changed

- When a valid root handler is configured by the user, `inv._project.rootHandler` is no longer `configured`, and is instead the specific root handler's `name` property
  - Example: `@http get /` would result in `inventory._project.rootHandler` being `get /`


### Fixed

- Fix `@aws` `policies` + `layers` where multiple policies or layers listed in one line would ignore all but the first

---

## [2.0.0 - 2.0.4] 2021-07-22

### Changed

- Default runtime is now `nodejs14.x`, fixes #1164
- Breaking change: removed support for Node.js 10.x (now EOL, and no longer available to created in AWS Lambda) and Node.js 12.x
- Breaking change: removed support for Architect 5 WebSocket folder paths (prepended by `ws-`)
- Updated ASAP to v4
- Updated dependencies

---

### Fixed
